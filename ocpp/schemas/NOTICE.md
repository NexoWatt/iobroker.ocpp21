# NOTICE (OCPP JSON Schemas)

This adapter ships *bundled* JSON schema collections for **OCPP 2.0.1** and **OCPP 2.1**.

These bundles were generated from the official **OCPP part 3 JSON schemas** provided by the
**Open Charge Alliance (OCA)** ("all_files" archives).

- OCPP 2.0.1: *Edition 4* (part 3 JSON schemas)
- OCPP 2.1: *Edition 2* (part 3 JSON schemas)

The schema bundles are used for:

- creating schema-valid minimal responses (auto-responder)
- keeping compatibility with newer actions/fields

If you redistribute this adapter, please ensure you comply with the licensing terms of the
original OCA OCPP specification and schema files.
